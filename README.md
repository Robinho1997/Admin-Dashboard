# Admin-Dashboard

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard

Here i did the challenge from the Odin Project to create an Admin-Dashboard with HTML and CSS.

I used mainly Grid and a bit oF Flex.

Thanks to this challenge i dived a lot more into grid and learned how useful it is to use Grid for multi dimensional layouts.
